  <!-- A fragrant tea infused with leaves of the psychoid plant. Drinking it induces a subtle psychite euphoria. This tea is easy to produce at cooking facilities, but can produce psychite addiction if consumed too often.\n\nMany tribes use psychoid tea, both as a daily energizer and as part of social and religious rituals. -->
