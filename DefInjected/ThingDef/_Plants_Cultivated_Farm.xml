  <!-- devilstrand -->
  <Plant_Devilstrand.label></Plant_Devilstrand.label>
  <!-- This fragile mushroom was genetically engineered to produce a silk net that is both difficult to tear and soft to the touch. While the mushroom takes a very long time to grow, only exotic ultra-tech fabrics outperform its devilstrand fibers.\n\nSome say it's called devilstrand because of its red color. Others think it owes its name to the greed it inspires in people. -->

  <!-- healroot -->

It is sometimes also called "healer's hand" by tribespeople - a nickname it owes to its five major medicinal virtues. -->
