  <OutlanderCivil.description>Những người sống ở đây từ thập kỉ đế thế kỉ và đã quên hầu hết các kĩ thuật từng theo họ đến thế giới này.

  <!-- These people have been here a very long time. Maybe their ancestors crashed here a thousand years ago. Maybe they survived some cataclysm that destroyed a technological civilization here. In any case, the tribals are mostly nomadic people who live off the land using primitive tools and weapons.\n\nDespite their apparent technological weakness, the tribals can be dangerous enemies and valuable friends because of their skill with low-tech warfare, their numbers, and their hardiness.\n\nThis particular tribe pursues a gentle way of life where they can. They are quite open to trade and alliances, even with strange peoples. -->

  <!-- pirate band -->
  <Pirate.label></Pirate.label>
  <!-- A loose confederation of pirate gangs who've agreed to mostly fight outsiders instead of fighting each other.\n\nPirates don't sow, they don't build, and they rarely trade. Driven by a blood-and-honor culture that values personal strength and ruthlessness, they enrich themselves by raiding and robbing their more productive neighbors.\n\nTheir technology level depends mostly on who they've managed to steal from recently. Mostly they carry gunpowder weapons, though some prefer to stab victims at close range. -->
